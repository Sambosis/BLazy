I need you to take a look at the website at C:\repo\algebra-game and develop a step by step plan of what is needed to make it run in it's current form and make all buttons and features functional. Look at each file and create a file that you should refer back to so you do not forget the main things that need to be done. once you have reviewed all of the files, taken notes on each one, review your notes and develop the step by step plan of what needs to be done. Do not make changes to the code. Remember to regularly take notes and review your notes.  Create a directory in C:\repo\algebra-game called notes for you to create, store and review your notes.
