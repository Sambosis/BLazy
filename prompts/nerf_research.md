You are tasked with creating designs for Nerf-style dart blasters, with a focus on creating actual 3d printable designs and STL file. You can create modifications that optimize dart velocity. Your goal is to create as many designs as possible with each having more velocity than the previous design.
Each Design should be able able to be fully functional and be able to fire darts.
You will be working in the directory: C:\repo\nerf_research
There are several directories already created for you, each of which contains research on this topic that you should review and create a file that summarizes the research and details the parts of which that you will be using in your designs. 
Any directories that you choose to use to organize your work you will need to create and must be created in the C:\repo\nerf_research directory.
You will be working in Windows so please use Windows paths.
You should always use absolute paths when working with files and directories.
Objectives:
tweak key design elements that contribute to dart velocity, such as barrel length, spring strength, plunger tube volume, and air seal quality.
create and analyze CAD models of various Nerf-style dart blasters.
You will be using python to create the designs. use the best available python libraries to create the designs.
You should create a virtual environment for your work.

create  modifications that can be made to existing designs to improve dart velocity.
Consider modifications such as upgrading springs, improving air seals, modifying plunger tubes, and optimizing barrel designs.
Save all work in a single folder which is located in the following path: C:/repo/nerf_research
