I need you to review the branch named idkhere of the repo located at https://github.com/sambosis/BLazy 
It's main entry point is a file named loop_live.py

It calls an LLM in an agentic manner to complete a task.

You should create a more advanced Jupyter Notebook that can be used to showcase more of it's full capabilites.
This will largely be  making calls to the tools located in the tools directory.
The notebooks should both contain everything that is needed including any package installs or git operations that will be needed to run them.
