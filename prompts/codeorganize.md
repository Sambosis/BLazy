There is a folder in your projectdirectory is C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\codeorganize.
There is a folder C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\codeorganize\llm_gen_code that has 2 directories in it:
C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\codeorganize\llm_gen_code\directory_operations
C:\mygit\BLazy\repo\codeorganize\llm_gen_code\subprocess_operations
These were created and had many small python files moved into them that had a basic connection to the directory name. 
I need these to be grouped and classified in a much more sophisticated way.  We can ignore the preliminary classification and just treat all the python files the same no matter which director they were in. 
We could possibly ask an LLM to create it categorize them for us, but it might be faster to use some sort of clustering algorithm to create the clusters then you could come up with the name fror each cluster. There are many other possible method's and you should consider the options and decide which is best to have the files separated into directories that have descriptive names based on what the files inside of them do.
