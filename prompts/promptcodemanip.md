Create an interactive website for code analysis visualization that allows users to:
1. Upload Python files
2. View function relationships and dependencies
3. Search through code semantically
4. Visualize function call graphs

Please follow these specific steps:

1. First, create a complete directory structure at"C:\repo\testsite2" and set up a Python virtual environment.  You will be working in Microsoft Windows. So use the appropriate commands for Windows including powershell.  
- Also, make sure that the paths you use are complete paths including the drive letter. which will be C:\
- Show exact commands for creating and activating venv
- Include a requirements.txt file with all necessary dependencies
- Show pip install commands

2. Create a Flask-based website with the following features:
- A modern, responsive interface using Bootstrap
- A split-pane layout with file tree on left, visualization on right
- File upload functionality
- Code syntax highlighting
- Interactive visualization using D3.js for function relationships
- Search functionality that works across uploaded files

3. Implement these specific endpoints:
- /upload for file handling
- /analyze for code analysis
- /search for code search
- /visualize for generating graphs
- /api/functions for getting function details

4. Include complete error handling and user feedback

5. Write the complete code for:
- All HTML templates
- All JavaScript files
- All Python routes and logic
- All CSS styling
- All utility functions for code analysis


7. Include detailed comments in all code files explaining functionality


Please provide all code files, setup instructions, and testing steps in a clear, organized manner.
