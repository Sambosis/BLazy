Create an GUI Python App for code analysis visualization that allows users to:
1. Load Python files
2. View function relationships and dependencies
3. Search through code semantically
4. Visualize function call graphs
5. Advanced Code Analysis

Please follow these specific steps:

1. You will be working in Microsoft Windows. So use the appropriate commands for Windows including powershell.  
- Also, make sure that the paths you use are complete paths including the drive letter. which will be C:\
- use uv for your virtual environment and package manager. It is already installed for you. 
- use uv init to get started, uv venv for environment, Use uv add to add the necessary packages and uv run to run the app.

2. Create a python gui app using your choice of frameworks and libraries with the following features:
- A nice looking UI where you can switch between code view, graph view and advanced code analysis views. 
- File load functionality
- Code syntax highlighting
- Search functionality that works across loaded files

3. Write the complete code.

4. Include detailed comments in all code files explaining functionality

Please provide all code files, setup instructions, and usage notes in a clear, organized manner.
