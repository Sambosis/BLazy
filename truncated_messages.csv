user,"Develop a comprehensive function named convertBashToPowerShell that takes a Linux bash command as input and returns an equivalent PowerShell command. The function should be robust and capable of handling various cases, including:
Command Translation:
Accurately translate common Linux bash commands to their PowerShell counterparts.
Ensure that the function supports a wide range of commands, including file manipulation, process management, and network operations.
Arguments and Flags:
Correctly interpret and map bash command arguments and flags to their PowerShell equivalents.
Handle complex scenarios where arguments and flags differ significantly between bash and PowerShell.
Error Handling:
Implement error handling to manage unsupported commands or flags gracefully.
Provide informative error messages indicating why a particular command could not be translated.

Documentation:
Document the function with clear explanations of its logic and usage.
Include examples of input bash commands and their corresponding PowerShell outputs.
Example Input and Output:
Input: ls -l /home/user
Output: Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\user -Force
Input: grep 'pattern' file.txt
Output: Select-String -Pattern 'pattern' -Path file.txt
Ensure that the function is modular, allowing for easy updates and extensions to support additional commands in the future. The goal is to create a tool that seamlessly bridges allows a user that is proficient in Linux bash to be able to type bash commands and have them translated to PowerShell commands, providing users with a reliable way to translate and execute commands across platforms.
The goal is for it to work and be able to handle almost all file, directory, and system manipulation commands, but not become bloated worrying about every possible command.
* You MUST run the code after EVERY change to ensure it works as expected and without errors."

- Output: Equivalent PowerShell command
- Robust argument and flag translation
- Comprehensive error handling
- Modular and extensible design

3. Specific Features
- Wide command support
- Intelligent syntax mapping
- Informative error messages
- Clear documentation

4. Translation Priorities
- File manipulation commands
- Process management
- Network operations
- Core system commands

5. Development Constraints
- Pragmatic implementation
- Focus on practical translations
- Prioritize common use cases
- Ensure modularity
- Avoid exhaustive complexity

Primary Goals:
- Create a user-friendly command translation tool
- Bridge bash and PowerShell command ecosystems
- Provide reliable, intuitive translations
- Support core system and file management operations

Unique Characteristics:
- Handles most file/directory manipulation commands
- Provides clear, actionable translations
