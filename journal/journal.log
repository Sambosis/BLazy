Here's an updated journal entry for the project:

```markdown
# Project Development Journal: Code Analysis Visualization Website

## Initial Project Setup
- Created project directory at `C:/repo/testsite2`
- Set up virtual environment
- Created `requirements.txt` with necessary dependencies
- Established basic project structure with directories:
  - `app/`
    - `static/` (css, js, img, uploads)
    - `templates/`
    - `models/`
    - `utils/`

## Application Initialization
- Created `app/__init__.py` with:
  - Flask application factory method
  - SQLAlchemy database initialization
  - CORS support
  - Blueprint registration configuration

## Pending Tasks
1. Complete configuration file
2. Implement routes
3. Develop code analysis utilities
4. Create database models
5. Design frontend templates

### Challenges Encountered
- Dependency installation process requires further investigation
- Need to ensure complete virtual environment setup

### Next Steps
- Finalize `config.py`
- Implement `routes.py`
- Develop code analysis and visualization utilities
```

Would you like me to proceed with creating the next component of the application?
