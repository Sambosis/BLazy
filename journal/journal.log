Project: Code Analysis Visualization Tool

Project Setup Progress:
1. Created Project Structure
   - Root Directory: C:\repo\testsite2
   - Subdirectories: 
     * static (js, css, uploads)
     * templates
     * analysis
     * utils
     * tests

2. Dependency Management
   - Created requirements.txt with comprehensive dependencies
   - Installed dependencies using pip
   - Key libraries included:
     * Flask for web framework
     * NetworkX for graph analysis
     * Pylint for code analysis
     * WTForms for form handling
     * Pytest for testing

Next Steps:
- Create initial Flask application structure
- Implement file upload mechanism
- Design code analysis utilities
- Develop visualization components

Challenges/Considerations:
- Ensure secure file handling
- Implement robust error checking
- Create intuitive user interface
- Develop modular, testable code

Current Status: Project initialization complete, ready for core development phase.
----------------------------

Would you like me to proceed with creating the initial Flask application files and setting up the basic project structure?
